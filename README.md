# AccessiBridge

AccessiBridge is a comprehensive web application designed to break down communication and accessibility barriers for people who are blind, deaf, or deafblind. The application provides a suite of tools that help users navigate the digital world with ease and communicate effectively.

## Overview

AccessiBridge is built with Flask and leverages Google's Gemini AI to provide intelligent image descriptions and document processing. The application is designed with accessibility as a core principle, ensuring that all features are usable by people with various disabilities.

## Features

### Image Describer
Upload any image and receive a detailed audio description. This tool is perfect for understanding photos, documents, or any visual content. The tool offers multiple description modes:
- Quick: One clear, concise sentence focusing on the main subject
- Detailed: Comprehensive description including colors, shapes, spatial relationships, and emotional tone
- Navigation: Structured description for understanding physical spaces or documents
- Deafblind Mode: Simple, structured format optimized for braille displays

### Speech to Text
Real-time transcription of spoken words. Converts speech into readable text instantly for easy communication. This feature is essential for deaf users who need to understand spoken content.

### Text to Speech
Convert any text into natural-sounding speech. Customize voice, speed, and pitch to your preference. This tool helps blind users access written content through audio.

### Communication Bridge
A two-way communication tool for deaf and hearing people to converse. Speech becomes text, and text becomes speech, enabling seamless communication between users with different needs.

### Document Reader
Upload documents and have them read aloud. Supports text files, PDFs, and images with text. The tool uses AI to extract and process text from various document formats.

### Saved Content
Access your saved descriptions, transcriptions, and texts for later use. All processed content is stored in a local database for easy retrieval.

### Text Simplification
AI-powered text simplification for easier understanding, particularly useful for deafblind users. Converts complex text into clear, structured formats with simple vocabulary.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend Framework**: Flask 3.1.2
- **AI Integration**: Google Generative AI (Gemini 2.5 Flash)
- **Database**: SQLite3
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- **File Handling**: Werkzeug
- **Python Version**: 3.14.2 (compatible with Python 3.7+)

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)
- Git (for cloning the repository)

### Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ZAJMS1/TSA-Software-Development-2026.git
cd TSA-Software-Development-2026
```

2. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On macOS/Linux:
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
   - On Windows:
   ```bash
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. (Optional) Set up Gemini API key for AI features:
```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```
   - On Windows:
   ```bash
   set GEMINI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
   ```

   Note: The application will run without the API key, but AI-powered features (image description and document OCR) will be limited.

## Running the Application

1. Ensure you're in the project directory and your virtual environment is activated.

2. Run the Flask application:
```bash
python app.py
```

3. The application will start on `http://localhost:5001` (port 5001 is used to avoid conflicts with macOS AirPlay on port 5000).

4. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5001`.

5. The application will automatically:
   - Create the uploads directory if it doesn't exist
   - Initialize the SQLite database with required tables
   - Initialize the Gemini API if the API key is provided

## Database Schema

The application uses SQLite with the following tables:

- **image_descriptions**: Stores image descriptions generated by the AI
- **transcriptions**: Stores speech-to-text transcriptions
- **user_preferences**: Stores user preferences and settings
- **saved_texts**: Stores user-saved text content
- **conversation_history**: Stores conversation history for the communication bridge

## API Endpoints

### Web Routes

- High contrast mode support
- Keyboard-only navigation
- Large click/touch targets
- Clear, readable fonts at large sizes
- Reduced motion support
- ARIA labels and roles throughout
- Skip to main content links
- Semantic HTML structure

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `GEMINI_API_KEY`: Google Gemini API key for AI features (optional but recommended)

### Application Settings

The application can be configured in `app.py`:
- `UPLOAD_FOLDER`: Directory for uploaded files (default: `static/uploads`)
- `MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH`: Maximum file upload size (default: 16MB)
- `ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS`: Allowed file extensions for uploads

## Supported File Formats

- Images: PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, WEBP
- Documents: PDF, TXT, DOC, DOCX

## Browser Compatibility

AccessiBridge is compatible with modern web browsers:
- Chrome/Edge (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Opera (latest)

## Development

### Running in Debug Mode

The application runs in debug mode by default when executed with `python app.py`. This enables:
- Automatic reloading on code changes
- Detailed error messages
- Debug toolbar (if configured)

### Database Management

The database is automatically initialized on first run. To reset the database, simply delete `accessibility.db` and restart the application.

## Troubleshooting

### Gemini API Not Working
- Verify that `GEMINI_API_KEY` is set correctly
- Check that the API key is valid and has not expired
- Ensure you have internet connectivity
- Check the console for error messages

### Port Already in Use
- The application uses port 5001 by default
- If the port is in use, modify the port in `app.py` (line 388)
- Alternatively, stop the process using port 5001

### Database Errors
- Ensure the application has write permissions in the project directory
- Check that SQLite3 is properly installed
- Delete `accessibility.db` to reset the database

### File Upload Issues
- Check that the `static/uploads` directory exists and is writable
- Verify file size is within the 16MB limit
- Ensure the file extension is in the allowed list
